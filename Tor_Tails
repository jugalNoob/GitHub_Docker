Surface Web: The surface web, also known as the visible web or the Clearnet, refers to the portion of
the internet that is easily accessible and indexed by search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo. It
consists of websites and web pages that are publicly available and can be accessed using standard web
browsers. This includes news sites, social media platforms, online shopping websites, educational
resources, and more. The content on the surface web is easily searchable and can be accessed by
anyone with an internet connection.


Deep Web: The deep web refers to the part of the internet that is not indexe
by traditional search engines and is not easily accessible through regular web browsers. This inclulles content that is behind
paywalls, password-protected websites, private databases, and other forms of
Examples of deep web content include subscription-based services, academic daRtivate File Sharingausing Oni
portals, medical records, and corporate intranets. While this content is not readily available 733,39
general public, it is not necessarily illegal or malicious in nature.


Dark Web: The dark web is a subset of the deep web that is intentionally hidden and requires special
software to access. It is not indexed by traditional search engines, and its websites use anonymity tools
like Tor (The Onion Router) to obscure the identities of both users and website operators. The dark
web is often associated with illegal or illicit activities, such as the sale of drugs, weapons, stolen data,
counterfeit currencies, and other illegal goods and services. However, it's important to note that not all
content on the dark web is illegal, as there are also legitimate use cases for anonymity, such as
whistleblowing and secure communication in oppressive regimes.
